Hardware Configuration
==========================

Below an overview graph of the suggested configuration is presented.

.. note:: Due to shortage of time the hardware configuration was implemented
  solely on a breadboard. Future improvements include the manufacturing of an
  arduino shield where the various motors will be mounted. This way the setup
  should be an easier more straightforward procedure 

.. todo:: add the various electrical components used

After the above steps you are ready to `explore the main window
<window-exploration.html>`_ and issue
commands to the arduino accordingly.
