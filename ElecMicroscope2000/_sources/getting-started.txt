Getting Started
========================

Packages required
*********************************

Downloading the software
*********************************
 
To download the project navigate to the corresponding `Github repository <https://github.com/bergercookie/ElecMicroscope>`_ and either clone the project or downlaod the zip version.

.. todo:: include the image

Before running the GUI, the user must have a series of packages and extensions
installed in MATLAB. These are described in the `Packages required` section
below. If everything looks OK, the user can then proceed and upload the Arduino
Code to the Arduino and then start matlab and launch the GUI from the
corresponding folder. 

.. todo:: include the arduino code image

A summary of the steps is also described below:

- Download the ZIP folder/ Clone the Github repository
- Upload the arduino code (ArduinoCode.ino) to the Arduino
- Launch matlab, and run the microscope program (make sure you are running it
  from inside its corresponding folder

After the above steps you are ready to explore the main window and issue
commands to the arduino accordingly.

.. warning:: Make sure you close MATLAB before trying to upload a differt
 : version of the arduino code. Otherwise the Arduino IDE will not be able to
 : upload the program using the specified port as MATLAB still has
 : read/write access to the port.
