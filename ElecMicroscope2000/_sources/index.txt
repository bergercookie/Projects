Guide to ElecMicroscope2000
==============================================

Graphical User Interface for using Arduino driven electrical microscope motors.
The task of the Arduino is to control a series of servomotors and steppermotors
which control the speciments platform for analysis, the filter positions and
lamp of the microscope, as well as the mounted camera on top of the microscope
used to take pictures of the speciments.
The software is implemented in both OSX and Windows platforms and is written
using the MATLAB GUIDE environment.
