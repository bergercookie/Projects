Getting Started
=========================================================

There are 2 ways of running the XP3000 GUI:

- Running the *Pump3000.exe* [Windows only]
- Running *from source* [Python required]

Either way the user must first download the necessary files for the software,
located at http://www.github.com/bergercookie/Pump3000. This can be 
done either by downloading the project locally from the github page or by cloning the project


The user can **download the software** by visiting the github page:
http://www.github.com/bergercookie/Pump3000 and then pressing 
the *Download Zip* button

Then in order to clone the project the user can run the git clone command::
