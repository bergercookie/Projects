GUI Overview
===================

Below a general overview of the GUI is presented.

Through the window, the user can interact with the following features:

- Camera pane

  + The user can capture an image using the 'Shoot' button. The photos taken are
    stored in internal buffer. The user can finally press the 'Save all' button
    to store them in the path specified
    This behavior can be altered through the 'Configure' drop-down menu
    (Configure > Save Intsantly). 

  + By default the saving directory is the one from which you launch the  
    program. This can be changed through the 'Configure' (Configure > Image
    Path...)

  + If the user decides not to permanently store the images taken until that point, he can press
    the  'Clear all' button. This clears all the images stored in the internal
    buffer. 

- Lamp - Filter pane

  + Using this panel the user can select when to turn on the the microscope lamp
    as well as select which filter of the microscope is in use. By default the
    lamp is OFF and the filter is set to position 3.

- Communication with the Arduino
  
  + At first the user must issue the port to which the arduino is connected to.
    This can be accomplished using the 'Arduino Port' option from the Confgure
    drop-down menu. 

  + When the arduino doesn't respond as expected the user can start debugging
    the communication  by sending arbitrary serial commands to the arduino and then
    reading the output written by the arduino in the serial. This can be
    accomplished using the 'Send Serial Command' pane located in the right-half
    plane of the GUI.

  + The log window is meant to give feedback to the user about each of the
    commmands they issue. It also provides two modes of communication [SERIAL]
    and [LOOP] so that the user knows wether the command is sent through the
    serial port to the arduino or not.

- XY Platform Control

  + The user can control the movement of the platform on which the speciments
    for analysis are set. Currrently 
    *the control panel for the platform is not functional* and the suggested way
    of controlling the platform is through the arrow keys [LEFT, RIGHT, UP,
    DOWN]. More specifically when the user presses (and holds) one of the
    buttons, the platform moves to the specified direction until the they let
    the key go. This way the motion of the platform is executed in an easy and
    intuitive way. 

.. warning:: The command issued is only sent to the serial if [SERIAL] is
 indicated  in the beginning of the corresponding log window message. If the
 arduino cannot be reached or if the connection has not been initiated then
 the communication is in [LOOP] mode, meant for testing purposes only.
