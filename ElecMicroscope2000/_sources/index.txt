Guide to ElecMicroscope2000
==============================================

Graphical User Interface for using Arduino driven electrical microscope motors.
The task of the Arduino is to control a series of servomotors and steppermotors
which drive a microscope. The user can also shoot pictures using any available
cameras and save them for further analysis.
The software is implemented in both OSX and Windows platforms and is written
using the MATLAB GUIDE environment.
